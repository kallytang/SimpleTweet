## Notes

I made the twitter screen similar to the current twitter application. I had some trouble with vectors, realized i can't convert png files into files that could be used for xml vectors. There's some images/icons that were missing and i had to create the comment icon myself. 

upload icon is from https://icons-for-free.com/box+document+outline+share+top+upload+icon-1320195323221671611/
